# ractor-tutorial

This repository conrains 3 tutorials that walks one through the world of Actors as implemented by 'ractor' framework.

The tutorials are divided into three parts for easier reading and these are in the following directories:

* ractor-tutorial-chapter-1 ([README](./ractor-tutorial-chapter-1/README.md)).
* ractor-tutorial-chapter-2 ([README](./ractor-tutorial-chapter-2/README.md))` 
  and `
* ractor-tutorial-chapter-3 ([README](./ractor-tutorial-chapter-3/README.md))`.

Each of these tutorials has its own README, `cargo.toml` and `src` directories. The accompanying blog is inside README, as well as in the directory `accompanying_contents`.

In order to run the code, one needs to move to the corresponding directory and issue the command: `cargo run`.
